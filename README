=== ABOUT ===

ConTagged is a webbased address book for small companies. It features a public
address book which is writable for all company staff and a personal address
book for each staff member. ConTagged requires an already setup LDAP server to
authenticate users and store it's data.

=== REQUIREMENTS ===

You need to have a running LDAP Server with some users (objectClass=posixUser)
in it. It is important that you already have these users because LDAPab uses
them to authenticate.

You need a webserver (peferable Apache) with PHP4. PHP4 needs to be compiled
with LDAP support (compiled in or as extension)

=== SETUP LDAPab ===

Copy the contents of the .tgz file to a directory below your webserver document
root. Make sure the webserver is able to write to the cache directory which is
used for the template engine's cache files. A 'chmod 777 cache' will do.

Open the config.php file in your favourite editor and edit the options
according to your needs. Some knowlege about LDAP may come in handy.

If HTTP auth is wanted have a look at the provided _htaccess file, edit it as
needed and rename it back to .htaccess

=== SETUP THE LDAP SERVER ===

The following only describes what to do for open-ldap 2.0! If you use any
other LDAP server you're left to our own.

You need to include the inetOrgPerson schema in you slapd.conf:

  include /etc/ldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema

If youwant to use the extended schema (needed for tagging and birthday support)
you need to copy the ldapab.schema file to /etc/ldap/schema/ and include it, too.

  include         /etc/ldap/schema/ldapab.schema

Be sure to enable the extended option in config.php.

To setup the access rights add the following statement to your slapd.conf. Of
course you have to replace "o=cosmocode,c=de" with your own root DN. The first
entry may have to adjusted also if your users aren't stored in a ou=people
entry. Make sure you include these lines before other access control lists that
match these parts of the ldap tree. If you are unsure have a look at the
included slapd.example file

  access  to dn="(.*,)?ou=contacts,cn=([^,]+),ou=people,(.*)$"
          by dn="cn=$2,ou=people,$3" write
          by * none

  access to dn.subtree="ou=contacts,o=cosmocode,c=de"
         by users write
         by * read

After this modifications you have to restart the slapd server.

The last thing is to add the contacts leafs to your LDAP tree. You'll need to
add a global contacts leaf at top.

  eg: 'ou=contacts,o=cosmocode,c=de'
  
And a contacts leaf for every user.

  eg: 'ou=contacts,cn=Joe Schmoe,ou=people,o=cosmocode,c=de'


If you made everything correct you can point your webbrowser to the newly
installed ConTagged and use it :-) If you encounter problems try to enable
logging in your LDAP server to see what the problem is.
